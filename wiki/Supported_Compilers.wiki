This library was primarily developed against GCC but should be portable across newer C++ compilers. That said it may not work on all toolchains due to dependencies on the compiler's virtual table ABI implementation and support for fairly old meta-template programming techniques.  This page will serve as a cross-reference of known supported compilers.  If you do not see your compiler listed, forward me the working status (yes/no & version) so I can update this page accordingly.
